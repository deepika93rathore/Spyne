1. Low-Level Design (LLD)
The LLD will focus on defining the detailed components, classes, and interactions within the system. Hereâ€™s an outline:

Components:
User Management
User Registration
User Login
User Profile Update
User Deletion
User Follow
User Search
Discussion Management
Create Discussion
Update Discussion
Delete Discussion
Comment on Discussion
Like Discussion
Like Comment
Reply to Comment
View Count Management
Search by Hashtags
Search by Text
Authentication
JWT based authentication
Search
ElasticSearch integration
Detailed Description of Each Component:
User Management:

User Registration: Endpoint to create a new user.
User Login: Endpoint to authenticate user and return JWT token.
User Profile Update: Endpoint to update user details.
User Deletion: Endpoint to delete a user.
User Follow: Endpoint to follow/unfollow another user.
User Search: Endpoint to search for users by name.
Discussion Management:

Create Discussion: Endpoint to create a new discussion.
Update Discussion: Endpoint to update an existing discussion.
Delete Discussion: Endpoint to delete a discussion.
Comment on Discussion: Endpoint to comment on a discussion.
Like Discussion: Endpoint to like a discussion.
Like Comment: Endpoint to like a comment.
Reply to Comment: Endpoint to reply to a comment.
View Count Management: Mechanism to track and update view counts.
Search by Hashtags: Endpoint to search discussions by hashtags.
Search by Text: Endpoint to search discussions by text.
Authentication:

JWT Based Authentication: Implement login and signup with JWT tokens for secure authentication.
Search:

ElasticSearch Integration: Implement search functionality for posts using ElasticSearch.
2. High-Level Design Document
This document will provide an overview of the system architecture and the interaction between components.

System Architecture Diagram:
The diagram will illustrate the main components and their interactions:

Frontend: User interface
Backend: REST APIs
Database: Storage for user data, discussions, comments, etc.
ElasticSearch: Search engine for discussions
Auth Service: Authentication microservice
User Service: User management microservice
Discussion Service: Discussion management microservice
Notification Service: Handles notifications for likes, comments, follows, etc.
Database Schema:
Users: User details
Discussions: Text, Image, Hashtags, Created on
Comments: Text, User, Discussion, Likes
Follows: Follower, Followee
Likes: User, Discussion, Comment
ViewCounts: Discussion, Views
3. API Documentation
Endpoint Definitions:
User Endpoints:

POST /api/users: Create User
PUT /api/users/{id}: Update User
DELETE /api/users/{id}: Delete User
GET /api/users: List Users
GET /api/users/search: Search User by Name
POST /api/users/login: Login User
POST /api/users/follow: Follow/Unfollow User
Discussion Endpoints:

POST /api/discussions: Create Discussion
PUT /api/discussions/{id}: Update Discussion
DELETE /api/discussions/{id}: Delete Discussion
GET /api/discussions: List Discussions
GET /api/discussions/search: Search Discussions by Tags or Text
4. Microservice-Based Infrastructure
Microservices:
User Service: Handles all user-related operations.
Discussion Service: Manages discussions, comments, likes, and views.
Auth Service: Manages authentication and authorization.
Search Service: Integrates with ElasticSearch for searching discussions.
5. Database Schema
Table Definitions and Relationships:
Users (user_id, name, mobile_no, email, password)
Discussions (discussion_id, user_id, text, image_url, created_on)
Comments (comment_id, discussion_id, user_id, text, likes, created_on)
Follows (follower_id, followee_id)
Likes (like_id, user_id, discussion_id, comment_id)
ViewCounts (view_id, discussion_id, views)
6. API Documentation Example
yaml
Copy code
# Create User
POST /api/users
Request:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "mobile_no": "1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
Response:
{
  "user_id": "1",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "mobile_no": "1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
7. Postman Collection
A Postman collection will be created with all the API endpoints for testing. The public link to this collection will be shared.

8. System Implementation
The system will be broken down into microservices and implemented using a suitable technology stack (e.g., Node.js for backend, MongoDB for database, ElasticSearch for search).
